 # Description
 
 The project is a VR experience titled 'Genesis' set to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FH-q0I1fJY"> Genesis by Grimes </a>. The website involves spheres revolving around to form patterns and shapes. When connected to our controller made using an Arduino, you can control these patterns by tilting the device.
 
 # Inspiration
 
 When Soumen and I decided to work together we both decided we would like to create a VR experience. That's all we knew in the start and we were told by the professor that we had a long way to go conceptually. We started looking all over for inspiration.
