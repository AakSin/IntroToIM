[Link for this week's sketch titled Thunder](https://editor.p5js.org/AakSin/sketches/3ZqkH7YKn)

It uses nested **For Loops** to simulate the effect of thunder using p5.js

# Process

I had been playing with Perlin Noise after class and looked up a few examples of what I could do with 2D perlin noise (I had been confused between the difference of
1D and 2D Perlin Noise). I learnt that 2D Perlin Noise works like a coordinate system and I used that to simulate cloud like behaviour. I made very small rectanges to
simulate pixels and made them varying shades of black and white. I then set them in motion by changing their co-ordinates as well. The thunder like behaviour is simulated
by certain calculations on FrameCount, so that as the animation progresses there are moments where the intensity of the colors increases.

# Outcome

I am pretty satisifed with how the project turned out. One of the gripes I have with it is how it slowly turns completely white. I have tried fixing it but I don't get my
desired thungder effect if I fix it. I now have a more solid grasp on Perlin Noise as well.
