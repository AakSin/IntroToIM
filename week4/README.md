# Planning

I was inspired by [Aaron Sherwood's website](https://aaron-sherwood.com/).

# Coding

The coding part was very challenging. I tried solving this issue without using vectors at first. Without vectors, all the particles were moving in the same direction and 
I couldn't get the circle effect I wanted. I then started learning about vectors. All of the tutorials implementing vectors for an attraction-repulsions system involved an 
entire physics system like motion and velocity. I didn't want my particles to be in constant motion thus I didn't engange in that. After many failed attempts with text, I 
decided to go back to basics and tried implementing a vector system with just 2 particles. [Here's the link to the file with vector experiments](https://editor.p5js.org/AakSin/sketches/PW2UD2yys).

I then played around and finally implemented a particle system I was happy with text. I then added random and noise into the program to see the output I would get. I realized it
looked similar to caligraphy and decided to play with a Japanese font. Hence, the project is titled calligraphy. I have included various elements like smooth circle and color size change to 
emulate an actual brush.

# Todo

Something I'd like to implement is somehow make the calligraphy look more watery. Maybe I would have to increase the circle size to simulate a droplet effect.
