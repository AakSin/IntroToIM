# Creative Switch - Ring Switch

This week's assignment was to create a creative switch. Here's the link to it.

## Planning, Inspiration

The idea came to me from various sci-fi movies where in the people have some sort of wearable technology, and through certain gesture they can do certain things.
I wanted to do a gesture controlled switch as well and I went for the idea of using my hands somehow. I noticed that I was wearing rings and decided to make
my circuit from that.

# Process

I connected everything in the simple order we had to light up a LED in. Then I created a split between the last negative running wire. I connected one end to the first
ring and the second end to the second ring. Upon brining the 2 rings together, the bulb lights up, hence finishing the circuit.

# Learnings, To-Do and Challenges

This was my first time creating something with an Arduino or physical circuits/wires etc. I enjoyed the experience. I was very confused initially but then
I followed the diagram professor had uploaded in notes to create the simple circuit of an LED lighting up. Then I was confused as to where do I place my switch.
I realized I'll create a split somewhere in the circuit and that's where my switch sits. 

Thinking of how and where to create this split was the major challenge in this project.

I'd like to make the signal from rings wireless if possible in the future. Like upon touching the rings, there is a signal sent out that completes the circuit.
I do not like how the wires stick into the rings and I'd like to eliminate that by just sending a signal through the rings touching (to turn on the circuit).
