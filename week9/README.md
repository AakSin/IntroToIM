# Metronome Game

## Inspiration & Concept

I was practicing with a metronome before working on the project, and when I got to make the project I decided to create a metronome sort of game. The game basically works like this -

The Yellow LED can be controlled by the Potentiometer and it's blinking speed can be increased or decreased

The Green LED can be controlled by the button and pressing the button lights it up

The RED LED lights up when both the Green and Yellow are lit up at the same time

So, the concept of the game is to keep tapping the button in time with the Yellow LED.
